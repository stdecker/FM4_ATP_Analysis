# Analysis of ATP Production on Horiba FluorMax-4 (FM-4)

Still under development, but feel free to make changes. Excel sheet must be 2 columns, the first titled 'Time' with all time data (in s) and the second titled 'Intensity' with the light intensity data. I am going to develop inputs for standard curve data for actual ATP flux.
